### Installation:
To make the installation process seamless, we've provided an installer in the release tab of this repository. Download and run the installer, and you'll be ready to generate secure passwords in no time!

### Whatâ€™s Next:
This password generator is just the beginning. Stay tuned for the full password manager, which will offer comprehensive features like password storage, encryption, and managementâ€”all while maintaining user control on the client-side.
